# SF_29_FineGrainedQueue

# Home work of SkillFactori's cource C++, module 29.
Write method `insertIntoMiddle(const int value, const size_t pos)` for fine grained query.

The method should set a node with `value` into position `pos`. If the `pos` is greater the queue's size it shoud be set into the queue's end.
